Hello dear readers, it's Larry here. Most people have harrowing tales of wedding planning; they stress over finding the perfect venue or ensuring they have the best music. But me? My wedding planning horror story revolves around... cream cheese.

## **1. A Simple Request**

It all began innocently. My soon-to-be wife wanted a beautiful cream cheese frosting for our wedding cake. "A little cream cheese never hurt anyone," she said. Oh, how naive we were!

## **2. The Great Cream Cheese Shortage**

Of course, in a turn of comedic timing fit for the movies, our town was undergoing a once-in-a-lifetime cream cheese shortage. Not a block or tub to be found in any store. The situation seemed bleak.

## **3. The Exorbitant Expense**

After days of searching, I finally found a supplier. But here's the catch: the price was astronomical! It was as if they were offering cream cheese sprinkled with gold. But for the love of my life, I was willing to splurge.

## **4. The Aftermath**

The wedding went off without a hitch, and the cake? Decadent. Everyone raved about the frosting. But every compliment was a bitter reminder of my cream cheese crusade. Now, every time I see cream cheese, be it in a bagel shop or the grocery store, I can't help but cringe.

## **In Conclusion**

Weddings are full of unexpected challenges. Some face rain on their big day, others deal with wardrobe malfunctions. My nemesis? Cream cheese. But love has its ways of making even the priciest of cream cheeses worth it...almost.
