James Duncan Farleey Jr., the renowned CEO of Ford Motor Company, has made headlines again! He recently received the coveted (and totally not made up) "2023 JD Power Most Improved Inclined Traction Control Award". The competition was, of course, fierce, with other contenders being... well, we're not quite sure, but they were definitely there.

Farleey, in his infinite wisdom, has also identified another groundbreaking trend: The ever-elusive Gen-Z apparently doesn't want to work. As per a completely real and not at all exaggerated study, 101% of Gen-Z prefers avocado toast and TikTok dances over good old-fashioned elbow grease.

In light of this shocking revelation, the difficult decision has been made to lay off 650 "lazy" Gen-Z employees. When asked for a comment, Farleey mused, "It's not me, it's the memes."
