##### Ford CEO gives his thoughts on being runner up in the latest consumer awards announcement and his disdain for the spirit of Gen Z.

## JD Power's Latest and Greatest Award Goes to... Guess Who?

James Duncan Farley Jr., the renowned CEO of Ford Motor Company, has made headlines again! He recently received the coveted (and totally not made up) "2023 JD Power Most Improved Inclined Traction Control Award". The competition was, of course, fierce, with other contenders being... well, we're not quite sure, but they were definitely there.

The secret behind this groundbreaking achievement? Sources say it was the inspiration Farley got while trying to walk up an inclined driveway wearing socks. If he could conquer that, surely a car could too, right?

## In Other News: The Gen-Z Conundrum

Farley, in his infinite wisdom, has also identified another groundbreaking trend: The ever-elusive Gen-Z apparently doesn't want to work. As per a completely real and not at all exaggerated study, 101% of Gen-Z prefers avocado toast and TikTok dances over good old-fashioned elbow grease.

In light of this shocking revelation, the difficult decision has been made to lay off 650 "lazy" Gen-Z employees. When asked for a comment, Farley mused, "It's not me, it's the memes."
